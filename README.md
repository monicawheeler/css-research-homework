# Vendor Prefix

Browser vendors sometimes will add experimental or nonstandard CSS/JS so developers can experiment with new ideas while preventing breakage in code.

It's important to note that you should wait until vendor prefixes are no longer needed before using the code in production code.

Can I Use is a site that shows you the browsers that support what you are trying to use. For example, search for `run-in`. It shows you that this CSS feature is not supported in most browsers. If you search for `let`, it shows you that it is supported across most browsers.

There are many tools to assist with adding prefixes for you, some are online and some are used in build tools. Pleeease Play is a way to automatically generate vendor prefixes based on Autoprefixeres versions.
